1. To run multiple yaml files in docker compose, use the below:
      docker compose -f <file1.yaml> -f <file2.yaml> .... up
2. While doing the above step, if there are services that use the same port, there
   will be conflict, so change the port of one of them.
2. To establish network connection between the containers, add Networks with same name for all the required services
3. To inspect network in docker, do below:
      docker ps
      docker network list
      docker inspect <container id> | grep Network
3. In docker, the service may not run in the port after the networks is changed. In such scenario, we can run by:
      HTTP://<container name>:port/
4. Follow this guide for docker JWT auth: https://docs.open-metadata.org/v1.3.x/deployment/security/enable-jwt-tokens

1. For post api actions, such as create db in openmetadata, we need a valid service
      like snowflake, or bigquery etc.
2. Created a service in openmetadata databases using snowflake, and then used this service for
      for post api calls.
3. Before this created a snowflake trial account.
4. Ingested metadata using metadata ui , go to settings -> services -> databases
      -> select service -> add ingestion
4. Created CI workflows using github actions for catching lint errors and pytest python
files.
