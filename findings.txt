1. To run multiple yaml files in docker compose, use the below:
      docker compose -f <file1.yaml> -f <file2.yaml> .... up
2. While doing the above step, if there are services that use the same port, there
   will be conflict, so change the port of one of them.
2. To establish between the containers, add Networks with same name for all the required services
3. To inspect network in docker, do below:
      docker ps
      docker network list
      docker inspect <container id> | grep Network
3. In docker, the service may not run in the port after the networks is changed. In such scenario, we can run by:
      HTTP://<container name>:port/
